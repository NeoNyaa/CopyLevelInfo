Note: The divider constructed of the equals symbol (=) is dynamic, meaning that it is always the same length in terms of characters as the first line of text.
If line one was 23 characters long, the divider will be a string of 23 equal symbols (=), if line one was 56 characters long, the divider would be 56 characters long.
