# v1.0.0
 * Initial release of the project and hopefully the last, CPP is really not a fun language.

# v1.1.0
 * Updated to GD v2.206 and Geode V3

# v1.2.0
 * Updated to GD v2.2074 and Geode V4
 * Instead of hijacking the copy level id button, the mod now creates a new button entirely
 * Removed the song ID copy code as the introduction of songs that arent on newgrounds makes any level which uses nongs point to invalid links

# v1.2.1
 * Fix old mod.json syntax!?!?!?!?
